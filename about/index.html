            I didn’t always know I’d be a UX designer — but I’ve always loved solving problems, asking why, and building things that make people’s lives easier and more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I'm set to graduate from Drexel University in 2025. I’ve had the opportunity to design across industries, from financial services at Vanguard to internal tools at Comcast. No matter the space, my approach stays the same: listen deeply, design thoughtfully, and deliver experiences that feel natural, not forced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it’s building a scalable mobile design system, reimagining how users transact, or prototyping a new investor app flow, I approach every project with a blend of strategy, craft, and heart. Good design isn’t just how it looks — it’s how it works, feels, and lasts. That’s what I’m here to create.

            The internet is two things: 1. The single most revolutionary invention in communication, collaboration, and problem solving that humans have developed. 2. A place of unending, meaningless slop. I love the internet for it’s unparalleled ability to solve problems and do good, and that's part of why I love being a UX designer. So much of the modern internet is algorithmically manipulative, generated by artificial intelligence, and designed to harvest you for your personal time and information. But I believe the internet can still do good.

            I don’t expect to fix the internet. I’m ambitious, but not naïve. My goal is to create spaces that fosters the potential of humans and the internet to do good for each other. New technology has the power to solve crucial problems, but designers must listen to the Uncle Ben mantra: “With great power, comes great responsibility.” Designers all too often forget the ethical responsibility that we have with these tools. My goal is hold myself to a high standard to make sure the internet I help build is one solves problems, not one that creates more.
